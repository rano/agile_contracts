"Story Points" are assigned to User Stories by Consultant and measures how difficult or complex they are to implement.

"Velocity" measures how many Story Points Consultant can complete in a given Iteration.

Both parties acknowledge that design and functionality will emerge organically in continuous conversation between Consultant and Client to which both parties commit hereby.
Client shall present its review, changes, comments regarding a release and the next following Iteration planning meeting.  Client agrees to re-prioritize existing User Stories and to introduce new User Stories only at Iteration planning meetings.

User Stories shall be defined, refined or broken down at the Iteration Planning Meeting, in dialog between both parties.  Consultant will ensure in cooperation with development team that resulting User Stories are recorded and estimated in their complexity in Story Points as that time.  Client will be able to use current Velocity to predict how many Stories can reasonably expected to be completed by the end of the Iteration.

Exhibit A

Agile Software Development Principles



Agile Software Development Principles are an industry standard approach to developing and maintaining software projects. There are four key tenets to the Agile Manifesto as publicized by the www.agilemanifesto.org: 
Individuals and interactions over processes and tools 
Working software over comprehensive documentation 
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation 
Responding to change over following a plan
