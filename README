I have created Agile Contracts as an "Open Contracts" project.  My goal is to bring the same effect of collaboration, transparency and continuous improvement to software consulting contracts as we are accustomed to in Open Source Code.  This is an early stage project; I've compiled these documents from various sources and many conversations.  Please fork this project and make your own improvements, let your laywer read them and contribute back.  Good luck.
